		<p>
			You indicate a creature that you can see to one or more allies,
			gesturing in a direction and describing the distance verbally.
			That creature is hidden to your allies, rather than undetected.
			This works only for allies who can see you and are
			in a position where they could potentially detect the target. If
			your allies can’t hear or understand you, they must succeed at
			a Perception check against the creature’s Stealth DC or they
			misunderstand and believe the target is in a different location.
